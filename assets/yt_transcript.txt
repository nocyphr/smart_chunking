00:00:03.399 something much better so in the next
00:00:04.880 hour Jesse ller is coming on and he has
00:00:06.919 a entire process for planning a monster
00:00:10.040 2025 I don't want to play catchup I want
00:00:12.320 to attack like now I'm taking control
00:00:16.239 and I'm dominating the year not other
00:00:19.080 people taking it away from me Jesse is a
00:00:22.039 incredibly successful guy he started

00:00:31.759 lived with David goggin if you don't
00:00:33.079 want to learn from this guy something's
00:00:34.399 wrong with you you're broken inside if
00:00:36.280 everybody does the three things that
00:00:38.840 we're going to talk about in
00:00:40.960 2025 and does everything else the same
00:00:44.079 at the end of the year if they see me in
00:00:45.640 an airport they're going to bear hug I
00:00:47.960 saw Sean writing like I like take notes
00:00:50.640 these are my golden nuggets from this
00:00:52.079 episode These are you know my pen dive
00:00:54.079 halfway through and now you added 20
00:00:57.000 winning habits you're Jason borne
00:01:01.719 you're decent board Jesse is amazing he
00:01:04.479 tells us this process that he's been
00:01:05.760 doing for the past 25 30 years I'm
00:01:07.720 pretty pumped about it and I think you
00:01:09.439 will be
00:01:11.760 [Music]
00:01:18.280 too I'm glad to be back man I love your
00:01:21.240 show I love that you got me back as a
00:01:23.400 repeat as a repeat offender so let me
00:01:26.119 just start by saying that you know I
00:01:28.880 love December
00:01:30.960 I think December and January is are
00:01:33.520 critical months for the 11 or 12 months
00:01:36.600 that follow them and as we head into the
00:01:39.240 new year you know the first thing that I
00:01:41.560 do like any business in America when we
00:01:44.560 get to the end of the year they close
00:01:46.520 out the year they have review sessions
00:01:49.119 what worked what didn't work you know
00:01:51.159 what was successful what wasn't
00:01:52.680 successful they give thems a grade Etc
00:01:56.000 and I found that um a lot of people
00:01:58.079 don't do that in their own personal life
00:02:00.079 so I like to take a little inventory in
00:02:02.159 December and just kind of have a little
00:02:04.159 review process around how the year went
00:02:07.159 and and and take inventory on my own
00:02:08.919 personal year but like no one taught me
00:02:11.520 how to set up my life you know like no
00:02:14.160 one taught me how to like deal with my
00:02:16.080 emails and no one taught me how to
00:02:17.599 schedule properly I never like I didn't
00:02:19.720 take a class in school that like hey
00:02:21.680 you're gonna have four kids you're gonna
00:02:22.840 get bombarded with emails from from the
00:02:25.640 school with all kinds of appointments
00:02:27.400 and zoom calls that we didn't have back
00:02:29.640 then and you know your calendar is going
00:02:31.400 to fill up with other people's requests
00:02:33.160 for your time like how do you want to
00:02:34.800 deal with that so you have enough time
00:02:36.720 to do things that you want to do and
00:02:39.440 achieve the goals that you want to do
00:02:41.840 within work and outside of work no one
00:02:44.200 taught me that and then layer in
00:02:46.080 children and layer in a wife that works
00:02:47.959 in a business as an entrepreneur and
00:02:50.760 like how do you do that so you know like
00:02:53.760 I'm a product of trial and era I tried a
00:02:55.440 lot of stuff I didn't grow up with a
00:02:57.319 phone I was scheduling everything on a
00:02:59.040 paper calendar for literally 45 years of
00:03:02.760 my life um you know and um and I had a
00:03:07.799 figure out like what as my life ebol how
00:03:10.280 to grow with it so I have a pretty cool
00:03:12.840 system I'm happy to share it with you
00:03:14.440 guys it's worked really well it's
00:03:15.799 allowed me to to balance a lot of things
00:03:19.239 and get a lot of things done and I think
00:03:20.760 it's pretty simple and I will preface it
00:03:23.120 by saying that um you know as you get
00:03:25.920 older how old are you guys 35 and 36
00:03:29.360 right yeah six all right so you got
00:03:31.519 another maybe decade before this hits
00:03:33.840 but it will hit and it's
00:03:36.040 inevitable as you get older creating
00:03:38.920 newness becomes really
00:03:41.360 hard because you live in routine you
00:03:44.319 know and like it gets very comfortable
00:03:46.360 to be to live in routine and really I
00:03:49.239 found that the only way to really
00:03:51.040 guarantee that you create newness and
00:03:52.680 newness is important it's important to
00:03:55.000 relationships it's important to your
00:03:57.319 momentum and your enthusiasm and your
00:04:00.319 success and your excitement towards
00:04:02.599 thing and your growth the only way to
00:04:04.720 create newness I found is the
00:04:07.720 planet and or leave room to be
00:04:10.439 spontaneous so I become a really
00:04:12.599 aggressive planner and I feel like a lot
00:04:15.040 of us played um life on defense our
00:04:18.600 calendars fill up with other people's
00:04:20.478 requests for time like I mentioned Zoom
00:04:22.639 calls weddings appointments school stuff
00:04:25.120 and at the end of the year like you
00:04:26.280 don't have a lot to show for it what are
00:04:28.479 the categories I do Family Fitness
00:04:30.440 Finance fun do you have like your own
00:04:32.280 like cute acronym uh for your categories
00:04:35.919 well I do my own individual personal
00:04:37.919 audits for business with my teams but
00:04:40.280 then from my personal thing Adventure is
00:04:42.199 a category for me I try to look through
00:04:44.880 like what kind of Adventures did I have
00:04:47.120 like I said and we'll get into this in a
00:04:48.479 minute you know you want to have
00:04:49.720 something to show for all your hard work
00:04:51.199 at the end of the year not your Zoom
00:04:52.880 calls I'm not like yes in October I lit
00:04:56.000 it up on Zoom I'm not doing that I'm
00:04:59.120 like oh just I just took a one-on-one
00:05:01.000 trip with my daughter to New York City I
00:05:02.880 just got back so stuff like that I'm
00:05:05.000 like really taking inventory on how much
00:05:07.199 time did I spend with my kids you know
00:05:09.759 what did I do well what I do what I have
00:05:11.280 to work on in my like I really really do
00:05:13.360 do that and then I try to close out the
00:05:15.320 year and I have a system for closing out
00:05:18.160 the year I'll share it with you guys
00:05:19.319 really quickly and like the overall
00:05:21.319 theme of closing out a year and I think
00:05:23.240 everyone should take a couple hours to
00:05:25.440 do this I think it builds momentum and I
00:05:28.319 think it gives you a little closure
00:05:29.759 around the year whether you had a great
00:05:30.960 year or a bad year it gives you a fresh
00:05:33.000 start for 2025 which I think is is
00:05:35.600 really really important and um the theme
00:05:38.720 is I want to come into the new year
00:05:40.400 light I want to feel light and I want to
00:05:43.120 get rid of all the email baggage all the
00:05:46.039 to-do list all this I don't want to have
00:05:47.919 a lot of carryover going into the new
00:05:49.720 year I want to kind of clean my hands
00:05:51.600 and just be light now this might sound
00:05:53.440 ridiculous it starts in my closet I go
00:05:56.600 through my closet I look at all the
00:05:58.199 stuff that's been hanging there for 12
00:06:00.160 months that I've never worn you know and
00:06:02.840 I donate it I get a big bag if if
00:06:06.120 anything is a 5050 do I want to keep it
00:06:08.000 or don't want to keep it I just say
00:06:09.680 someone needs this more than me it goes
00:06:11.280 in the Donate box and I start to
00:06:13.319 organize my closet so when I walk in I
00:06:16.039 don't have a ton of decisions you might
00:06:18.479 see me wearing very a shirts very
00:06:20.919 similar to this because I don't have a
00:06:23.039 lot of options you know I keep what I
00:06:25.680 like I get rid of what I don't like and
00:06:27.639 I get super clean my desk I get rid of
00:06:30.400 all the Clutter on my desk I want I
00:06:32.919 don't want to walk in and I got stacks
00:06:34.560 of things I got to go through and bills
00:06:36.400 and stuff I get super clean on my desk
00:06:39.120 my emails I'm a big hit delete and
00:06:41.960 explode them all at the end of the year
00:06:43.479 guy um but before I do that I put things
00:06:46.240 in files I respond to the things that I
00:06:48.360 owe an answer to I delete the stuff that
00:06:50.880 I don't need everything else goes into a
00:06:52.720 folder and I try to go in Net Zero into
00:06:56.120 2025 that's really important I don't
00:06:58.360 want to come back back from my vacation
00:07:00.639 January 1 and be sitting with an inbox
00:07:03.199 with 700 emails and just like you know
00:07:06.039 just feel like I have to play catchup
00:07:08.240 the first 30 days of the year I don't
00:07:10.000 want to play catchup I want to attack I
00:07:12.639 want to attack so I come in I come in
00:07:15.000 naked on my emails I
00:07:17.800 unsubscribe I go through all the stuff
00:07:19.919 that I have subscriptions to I
00:07:22.240 unsubscribe I un I delete all the apps
00:07:25.000 that I use again just trying to get
00:07:27.160 light you know I get rid of all clear
00:07:29.840 out all the apps I clear out my cars
00:07:32.680 make sure that you know have no clutter
00:07:34.160 in there and um I create files for
00:07:37.680 20125 where you know maybe I I'm still a
00:07:40.319 paper guy so I keep records of my
00:07:42.759 medical files I know people have them on
00:07:44.800 digitally but I keep a paper file I
00:07:46.879 still get my bills paper I put them in
00:07:49.720 files so but again I I have a system so
00:07:52.919 I'm not like playing catchup and um so I
00:07:56.440 come I get super light on all that stuff
00:07:59.680 and then I can't recommend this enough I
00:08:03.520 write handwritten letters to the 20 to
00:08:07.520 30 people that really impacted me or
00:08:10.280 helped me even you guys man having me on
00:08:13.280 you know you might get a thank you note
00:08:14.639 thank there 8 billion people in the
00:08:16.199 world guys thank you too for having me
00:08:18.639 on your podcast like you thought of me
00:08:21.080 thank you I write I write in you know a
00:08:23.520 handwritten letter to my suppliers my
00:08:26.199 contractors maybe a teacher my son's
00:08:28.720 coaches for football I want to thank
00:08:30.680 them this year you know um with no
00:08:34.719 purpose other than really giving like a
00:08:36.880 thank you I've been doing this about
00:08:38.679 that for 30 years when I was 23 years
00:08:41.519 old and I had no money and I was
00:08:43.279 sleeping on 18 different couches my
00:08:45.720 entire marketing strategy was I wrote 10
00:08:48.040 handwritten letters a day and I mailed I
00:08:50.240 wrote 3,000 letters I'm not even kidding
00:08:53.560 and I still to this day do that because
00:08:55.600 it breaks through the Clutter people
00:08:57.920 remember it people read their mail they
00:09:00.320 might not read their DMS text slacks and
00:09:03.279 all that stuff but they read their
00:09:04.480 letters that come in the mail and
00:09:06.800 there's a different intention I took the
00:09:09.160 time I wrote it I licked the envelope I
00:09:11.600 went to the mailbox I put a stamp on it
00:09:13.640 I put it in there like it comes with a
00:09:15.600 lot of love man is a lot different than
00:09:17.839 hitting send on an email are you still
00:09:19.959 doing are you still doing all that or
00:09:22.040 I'm not gonna talk about anything I
00:09:23.040 don't do no what I meant is uh I've like
00:09:26.440 wanted to send email uh letters to a lot
00:09:28.560 of people and then
00:09:30.079 I'll be like but is there a service
00:09:32.720 where I can just type it out and they
00:09:34.480 mail it out for me yeah it doesn't work
00:09:37.600 that
00:09:39.480 way he's like are you
00:09:42.440 listening no I I the audio coming
00:09:44.880 through I do it by the way I send
00:09:46.800 letters as well but then I like have a
00:09:48.680 stack I have like um a few years ago I
00:09:50.800 got some stationary and it like feels
00:09:52.200 good to like write letters to people but
00:09:53.760 every once in a while I'm like I don't
00:09:54.720 feel like writing this is there a
00:09:56.519 service and then I'm like what the hell
00:09:57.920 am I doing and so I wasn't sure you're
00:10:00.160 doing yeah you can't Outsource it you
00:10:03.560 can't Outsource it you know um as a
00:10:06.079 business owner like I've realized that
00:10:08.959 you can't Outsource Soul you know and
00:10:11.839 the DNA of a business is the soul of the
00:10:15.040 business the heartbeat of a business you
00:10:17.240 can't Outsource that and customers feel
00:10:19.720 soul and your friends feel soul and when
00:10:22.480 you start Outsourcing things that you
00:10:25.680 know for hundreds of years humans have
00:10:27.440 been doing themselves it loses a little
00:10:30.079 bit and I found that that twoh hour
00:10:32.360 investment how about this let's do an
00:10:34.440 experiment for your listeners take 10
00:10:37.279 envelopes 10 take 10 pieces of paper and
00:10:40.600 take 20 minutes and write a thank you
00:10:44.440 note or to your parents to your kids
00:10:47.240 teachers whoever saying hey this year I
00:10:50.120 just want to thank you for investing so
00:10:51.720 much time with my kids or whatever you
00:10:53.440 want to write lick the stamp put in an
00:10:56.200 envelope and watch the return on
00:10:58.600 investment
00:11:00.279 watch the return on
00:11:01.920 investment and I found that um there's
00:11:05.959 nothing like quite like it now that
00:11:07.880 might sound ridiculous hokey but I've
00:11:09.959 been do it for 30 years and people still
00:11:11.720 thank me no one gets a letter from you
00:11:15.480 like that and doesn't remember or hit

00:13:57.920 yourself up for success next year now
00:14:00.759 let's get back to the
00:14:02.800 episode so the first thing is is closing
00:14:05.399 out the year getting light doing all
00:14:07.839 those things you know to get light
00:14:10.120 writing handwritten letters and then the
00:14:12.560 the other thing that I do is I I try to
00:14:15.399 identify like what I want to fix going
00:14:18.839 into next year because you know like
00:14:21.160 everybody wants to be a 10 out of 10 no
00:14:23.079 one signed up to be an 8 out of 10 the
00:14:25.399 80 you know a B minus everybody wants to
00:14:28.120 be as close to they a 10 out of 10 but
00:14:30.480 if you have certain things that are
00:14:32.000 broken even if you make a bazillion
00:14:34.360 dollars and your business goes up 50%
00:14:37.160 and your crazy growth you're never going
00:14:39.360 to be a 10 out of 10 if like the
00:14:41.240 marriage is broken you know something is
00:14:44.199 wrong whatever so what I always tell
00:14:46.560 people to do is imagine you guys had you
00:14:48.839 guys can do this right now imagine you
00:14:51.360 had a big
00:14:52.600 blender and in the blender you put all
00:14:55.800 the buckets Sam that you were just
00:14:57.240 talking about all the buckets in your
00:14:58.759 life into the blender your finances your
00:15:01.160 health your weight your relationships
00:15:03.600 where you live like everything going on
00:15:05.600 in your life put it in a blender shake
00:15:07.320 it up and then on a one to
00:15:10.680 10 with 10 being like the ultimate in
00:15:14.120 happiness and one being Rock Bottom like
00:15:17.759 again what's your number your weight
00:15:19.720 your relationships your work your
00:15:21.639 finances you put it all in your shake
00:15:23.320 are you a seven are you a five you don't
00:15:25.079 have to tell me are you an eight are you
00:15:27.160 what like what are you now what I love
00:15:29.240 about that exercise is immediately your
00:15:32.040 brain goes to a 10 and then the two or
00:15:34.880 three things that are bothering you pop
00:15:36.639 in your head like crystal clear and take
00:15:38.959 that number down so maybe it was like oh
00:15:41.199 my finances aren't there or like I hate
00:15:43.279 my job or things aren't great in my
00:15:45.560 whatever came into your head those are
00:15:47.440 the things you got to work on they're
00:15:48.959 not going to magically get better like
00:15:51.880 you don't just like oh you know like my
00:15:54.600 my relationship stinks it just like
00:15:56.720 magically get better you got to work on
00:15:59.319 it and did anything pop into your guys
00:16:00.920 head right away yeah so I I put it all
00:16:04.000 in the blender I got to an eight and a
00:16:06.279 half and right away you're you're right
00:16:08.160 I started at a 10: because I'm I'm happy
00:16:10.120 right and then I said
00:16:11.680 well I do the weight's got to come down
00:16:14.240 a little bit all right the weight's got
00:16:15.399 to come down a little bit so that's
00:16:16.399 that's a point off you're not I want to
00:16:17.800 have healthy habits that I'm proud of
00:16:19.839 and then the second one was um you know
00:16:23.199 I I think I'm really good at this
00:16:24.519 content thing I love making content but
00:16:26.399 I'm still spending way too much of my
00:16:27.880 time in my business is and I I really
00:16:30.480 want to make that shift from operator to
00:16:32.040 Creator and i' i' made I've made good
00:16:33.839 progress but I'm not all the way where I
00:16:35.079 want to be there I had a six I had a
00:16:37.519 daughter and I'm loving being a father
00:16:39.480 and she's fantastic that's a 10 finances
00:16:42.880 I did really well that's a 10 but I'm
00:16:45.920 bombarded with inbound messages and I
00:16:48.360 don't have a system to where I'm saying
00:16:52.040 no to 10 minutes at a time uh the
00:16:54.440 10-minute time requests and contact
00:16:57.079 switching is ruining my life it feels
00:16:59.240 like I can't get in the flow so I'm
00:17:00.519 going to give my give it a
00:17:02.319 six okay a six overall yeah because the
00:17:06.959 context switching it like I get so much
00:17:10.079 joy being in the flow of something and I
00:17:12.760 both a combination of lack of system and
00:17:15.359 addiction to social media and text and
00:17:17.760 all that [ __ ] it's brought me down a
00:17:20.160 whole bunch you know two thoughts one
00:17:23.000 when you're doing the exercise there's
00:17:24.599 no comparison against anybody else so
00:17:27.319 like you know if you are comfortable
00:17:29.280 with the money you're making or whatever
00:17:30.559 you're not comparing yourself to Buffet
00:17:32.799 it's like you know I'm comfortable where
00:17:34.880 I am you're never going to win the
00:17:36.320 comparison game because there's always
00:17:38.160 gonna be someone so that's one thing
00:17:40.720 just to think about and then you know
00:17:42.600 not to knock you at all Sam I think that
00:17:44.200 was super honest of you but like for
00:17:46.320 anybody out there that was a six if like
00:17:47.919 if my son comes home with a 60 on a test
00:17:50.360 it's an F yeah no but I'm agreeing with
00:17:52.960 you like it it it brought me down a lot
00:17:55.159 but the good thing is it's all fixable
00:17:56.799 and you have to identify it and like
00:17:58.520 look I'm not here to be a therapist or
00:18:00.400 preach all I'm saying is knowing what
00:18:02.880 those things that are that need a little
00:18:04.440 bit of help and if it's your weight you
00:18:06.520 know then just in 2025 be like you know
00:18:08.760 what man everything's clicking I'm gonna
00:18:11.840 address this I'm just GNA be a little
00:18:13.640 that's all you know so but but you have
00:18:15.799 to my point is for the listener like you
00:18:19.440 got to identify it because if you don't
00:18:22.159 it just keeps compounding and and then
00:18:25.200 you're playing it's just harder to like
00:18:27.200 catch up when it's compounding so you
00:18:29.280 close out the year you get light you
00:18:30.679 clean the closet clean the desk clean
00:18:32.679 the cars you email bankruptcy you get
00:18:36.400 the files you write the handwritten
00:18:37.919 letters you give thanks you do the
00:18:39.840 blender exercise you identify the two or
00:18:41.679 three shifts I'm trying to make that is
00:18:43.520 that clo is that how you close out the
00:18:45.080 year or is there anything else to that a
00:18:46.799 personal review and just to make it
00:18:48.720 super practical are you like writing
00:18:50.880 this down are you just thinking about it
00:18:52.760 do you say it out loud do you do this
00:18:54.159 with somebody else do you look at your
00:18:55.400 calendar how do you even go back through
00:18:56.640 the could you just give us like if I
00:18:58.280 wanted to say down an hour after this
00:18:59.799 cuz I'm so pumped after this episode I
00:19:01.440 wanted to go do this can you just give
00:19:03.400 me the like kind of the a little more
00:19:05.320 detailed instruction on how I would do
00:19:06.600 it well I get really excited about
00:19:09.320 getting light like you know so I don't
00:19:11.039 have to write anything down to clean up
00:19:12.360 clean my closet and my desk and my
00:19:14.120 emails like that's all just something
00:19:15.679 that like you know you feel accomplished
00:19:18.240 when you do that and we're doing all the
00:19:20.919 other stuff anyway we're we're we have
00:19:22.760 businesses we're doing all this but you
00:19:24.679 just feel really good about yourself as
00:19:27.440 far as like handwritten letters I do
00:19:29.320 make a list I keep it every year of like
00:19:31.400 kind of just man I just think about like
00:19:33.640 what podcast were I on for me was I on
00:19:36.720 who really went above and beyond for me
00:19:38.559 this year or my kids or my family you
00:19:41.679 know I had a I went on a trip to to
00:19:43.640 Africa we had a great tour guide um I
00:19:46.120 had a gentleman in Kenya that ran with
00:19:47.960 me every day to to like chaperon me
00:19:50.000 through the jungle I'm GNA understand
00:19:51.640 him and like just that kind of stuff and
00:19:53.600 I don't want anything for it just makes
00:19:55.760 me feel good and I know it probably
00:19:57.799 makes them feel good so I do all that
00:20:00.440 and then I and then like again you just
00:20:02.840 took that exercise took 30 seconds to
00:20:05.039 identify what we got to work on and then
00:20:07.480 I just make a me a mental note about it
00:20:09.240 like you know I want to get better at it
00:20:11.280 this whole process we're talking about
00:20:12.919 it's like super fast all right so that's
00:20:16.120 the first thing the second thing I do is
00:20:18.679 I have a planning
00:20:20.280 system that I've been using that I I
00:20:23.640 swear by it's there's three steps and
00:20:25.600 this is what I was talking about if you
00:20:26.840 do these three things you going to bear
00:20:29.120 hug me very simple so the first thing
00:20:32.120 that I do is um there's an old Japanese
00:20:35.840 ritual called the
00:20:38.080 misogi and we took we took the liberty
00:20:40.640 to tweak the exact definition of it it
00:20:43.400 but but the way we look at it is that
00:20:45.720 the the concept around a misogi is every
00:20:49.240 year you do one big year defining thing
00:20:53.080 so again at the end of the the year even
00:20:55.400 though you're busy with all this stuff
00:20:56.600 you have one year defining thing thing
00:20:59.360 that to really show for your time over
00:21:02.039 the 365 so for example like two years
00:21:04.960 ago and this is big I rode my bike
00:21:07.440 Across America last year I did rim to
00:21:10.039 rim to rim with some friends in 2015 I
00:21:12.760 launched a book living with the seal
00:21:15.279 2017 I launched a company called 2929
00:21:18.679 like every year going back literally
00:21:21.200 like you know 20 years ago I can name
00:21:25.000 like the one thing that I did that was
00:21:27.559 really really year Define so at the
00:21:29.360 beginning of the year I just I might not
00:21:31.679 have that idea and that could be like
00:21:32.840 I'm going to launch a podcast I'm going
00:21:34.679 to quit smoking I'm going to run my
00:21:36.240 first marathon you know but like what is
00:21:39.200 that one thing that you're gonna look
00:21:40.640 back to someone says was your I was
00:21:42.360 unbelievable man I roll my freaking bike
00:21:45.080 across the country I ran the New York
00:21:47.480 Marathon this year you know I think
00:21:49.960 that's really really important now a
00:21:53.520 it's important because like you want to
00:21:55.799 have somebody to show for it but D um
00:21:59.120 I find when you have something on the
00:22:01.279 calendar a goal something like that
00:22:04.080 you're something that you're working
00:22:05.480 towards um that's
00:22:08.799 challenging you you show up at work and
00:22:13.159 at home
00:22:14.880 completely different you show up
00:22:17.279 completely different a if I'm running a
00:22:19.880 New York Marathon Sam I now have to say
00:22:22.799 no to the things that that I don't have
00:22:25.120 the time to give people because I got to
00:22:26.720 train I'm adding you know hours of
00:22:29.080 training in so not now you have a
00:22:30.760 vehicle to say no to things but B you
00:22:33.200 know have something that you're looking
00:22:34.200 forward to one of the books that I read
00:22:35.880 this last year I think it was Michael
00:22:37.840 something uh Easter maybe uh the Comfort
00:22:39.840 crisis and he talked about the misogi I
00:22:41.840 had one it was a 50- mile race and the
00:22:43.840 the the Mogi was uh you have a 50%
00:22:46.320 chance of failing uh I ended up uh uh
00:22:49.600 hurting my achilles really badly and I
00:22:51.400 was like [ __ ] so I I failed uh and it
00:22:54.440 was awesome though have something look
00:22:55.960 forward I'm picking a new one now um
00:22:58.559 yeah but you didn't fail Sam you just
00:23:00.400 didn't finish yeah yeah yeah yeah but
00:23:02.840 but it was hard ass work and it was
00:23:04.240 awesome it felt great to have that on
00:23:05.360 the calendar yeah but what you did was
00:23:09.600 amazing you're saying I'm gonna go
00:23:11.400 double the longest run I've ever done in
00:23:13.320 my life okay I'm gonna do an
00:23:16.360 ultramarathon on top of everything I I
00:23:18.679 have going on I'm gonna challenge myself
00:23:20.679 it may or may not work that that's not
00:23:23.520 an F I mean that's an a an adventure you
00:23:26.679 just didn't finish it I mean not
00:23:28.880 everything we do is going to work I've
00:23:30.159 had businesses that have failed races
00:23:32.159 that I have dnfs but I love that you put
00:23:34.320 it on your calendar look my kids I have
00:23:38.279 four kids 15 10 10 and nine all right
00:23:42.159 you know what they're talking about
00:23:43.240 right now they're talking about that
00:23:45.159 we're going skiing in two weeks so
00:23:48.240 they're going to school and I'm like
00:23:49.600 guys two more weeks of school then we're
00:23:51.480 going skiing because that's on their
00:23:54.159 calendar it's helping them go through
00:23:57.240 school focused lock in because they know
00:23:59.799 they're going to get this reward winter
00:24:02.440 vacation coming up adults are the same
00:24:05.600 way like I'm willing to go work really
00:24:08.039 hard if I know I have a vacation coming
00:24:09.600 up or a race that I'm gonna do or
00:24:11.600 something that I'm excited about so
00:24:13.480 having one big year defining thing
00:24:15.919 really important do you know what yours
00:24:17.400 is going to be for 25 I don't I don't
00:24:20.440 and that's okay but I know that I'm
00:24:21.880 gonna have one and what it does is it
00:24:24.600 also like opens up my mind to Adventure
00:24:27.480 which Mogi do you look back out on most
00:24:29.520 fondly uh if you look back you know 10
00:24:31.480 years or so I did a race called Ultram
00:24:35.320 man which is a 6.2 mile Open Water Swim
00:24:39.320 a 275 mile bike and a 52 mile run and I
00:24:45.080 I I was insanely I was going to defer to
00:24:48.480 the following year two weeks before the
00:24:50.159 race because I didn't I had swam at all
00:24:53.919 I I didn't I didn't have a wet suit and
00:24:57.159 the water was 57 degree so I called it
00:24:59.399 my friend who's a coach and I'm like you
00:25:01.480 know listen I haven't been training at
00:25:03.520 all zero and there's no I don't think I
00:25:06.960 can do this and I'm thinking about
00:25:08.960 deferring thinking he's going to be like
00:25:10.760 of course defer train so you don't get
00:25:14.000 hurt and he was like absolutely not the
00:25:17.520 challenge is going to be you know if you
00:25:19.080 train for a year you're gonna be able to
00:25:20.440 do it you have no idea if you're going
00:25:22.760 to do it dude a six a six mile swim
00:25:26.520 alone would take like three and a half
00:25:28.559 hours right or if you're a bad swimmer
00:25:30.559 like me five but yeah and also like 57
00:25:33.720 degree Waters is I I did a a marathon 57
00:25:37.159 degre it was
00:25:38.320 horrible or Tron it was awful Sam I
00:25:41.640 showed up at the event and I jumped into
00:25:43.760 the water the day before and my I I
00:25:47.279 literally like my face hit the water and
00:25:50.120 it was like you're like I'm out out I'm
00:25:52.720 done it's like it's like it's like
00:25:54.200 getting punched in the nose like for the
00:25:55.640 first time when you want a box you're
00:25:56.919 like this sucks dude I don't I don't to
00:25:58.520 do this but I finished it I finished it
00:26:01.440 and um you know when I was going through
00:26:05.240 this event those th those kind of
00:26:07.480 challenges it's really important to
00:26:08.960 break things into digestible
00:26:11.159 bikes if you're starting a business you
00:26:13.320 want to put things into digestible bikes
00:26:16.120 so when I started Marquee jaet if they
00:26:17.960 would have said you need FAA approval

00:30:47.640 that and then you can go and get one of
00:30:49.039 those for free all right back to the
00:30:51.080 episode so if I'm getting this right the
00:30:53.200 misogi is more of a challenge something
00:30:56.480 that excites you something that it's a
00:30:58.240 big adventure it's year defining and you
00:31:01.000 have the you'll get the fun of progress
00:31:03.480 along the way as you make progress
00:31:04.840 you'll get the anticipation and then
00:31:06.200 you'll get the year defining a sense of
00:31:07.600 accomplishment whether you win or just
00:31:10.240 you did it um and then the adventures
00:31:13.480 are more about is that just more about
00:31:15.240 non- routine so just kind of making sure
00:31:17.919 you are not just every Saturday we go
00:31:19.760 here every Sunday we do this with my
00:31:21.200 kids and just shaking up the routine
00:31:23.120 with something fun it doesn't have to be
00:31:24.320 super challenging but is that the right
00:31:25.600 way to think about those absolutely it's
00:31:27.799 it's non routine it's planning Adventure
00:31:30.320 planning newness it's prioritizing
00:31:33.559 yourself and it's not it's it's playing
00:31:36.360 life on offense it's not letting your
00:31:38.240 calendar fill up you know look if we
00:31:40.519 just sit back it's going to be weddings
00:31:43.159 meetings conferences appointments and
00:31:46.840 just like what are we do what are we
00:31:48.840 doing how many of those things are uh
00:31:51.720 Jessie by himself or with buddies or
00:31:54.039 Jessie like the
00:31:55.519 family um I love I love to do things
00:31:59.600 with with my friends I love to do things
00:32:02.240 with my family I treat my family stuff
00:32:04.639 differently so I also plan family trips
00:32:07.480 but you know um I have the luxury of
00:32:10.240 time you know people talk about rich and
00:32:14.320 and the first thing that comes into your
00:32:15.880 head is like money obviously and that is
00:32:18.440 important and clearly that's an
00:32:20.039 important part of being rich but there
00:32:22.880 are so many buckets of Rich are you
00:32:25.880 spiritually Rich are you time
00:32:28.919 Rich I'm insanely Tim Rich right now
00:32:34.000 which I think is the most important
00:32:35.679 thing especially in your 50s I'm
00:32:38.480 insanely Tim Rich so I can I have the
00:32:42.679 luxury
00:32:44.399 of doing things
00:32:46.720 spontaneously when I want Etc I'm
00:32:49.960 spiritually Rich I'm socially
00:32:52.240 Rich if we did a little sidebar here
00:32:54.480 because the three of us are all lucky to
00:32:57.519 be in a a position where we don't have
00:32:59.399 to work we could all we could just spend
00:33:01.279 all year training for you know an MMA
00:33:03.919 fight an amateur MMA fight or whatever
00:33:05.440 it is but I think a lot of people who
00:33:07.039 listen to that you know may not be at
00:33:08.600 that you know they still have the job
00:33:10.240 they still have whatever the the you
00:33:11.600 know the day-to-day responsibilities so
00:33:13.320 could you take you know 30 seconds to
00:33:14.840 sort of speak to like how you would
00:33:16.919 maybe is there any difference in how you
00:33:18.760 would approach it you know the Mogi or
00:33:20.120 the adventures if somebody's not like
00:33:21.960 you know financially free where their
00:33:23.760 their calendar is Theirs to do whatever
00:33:25.480 they want with listen I have been doing
00:33:27.480 this since my journey was insane it was
00:33:31.360 crazy my 20s were were spent on couches
00:33:35.080 friends Apartments you know um just
00:33:38.799 trying to like figure it out pay my rent
00:33:41.440 you know all that stuff but I was still
00:33:43.919 so rich with Adventure every year I
00:33:46.480 would go to the Coney Island Polar
00:33:48.440 Plunge on New Year's you know what it
00:33:50.880 cost a subway token subway token you
00:33:53.799 know what it cost to do the trip to
00:33:54.799 Mount Washington with my kids $18 to
00:33:57.279 park we live in a country that offers
00:34:00.960 the most insane rivers mountains
00:34:04.559 national parks oceans hikes strings I
00:34:09.520 mean conferences
00:34:12.239 like you could fill up your life with
00:34:14.560 Adventure I should write a book filling
00:34:16.800 up your life on adventure you know for
00:34:18.879 under $400 a year because you can do it
00:34:22.079 now so you know I I understand that
00:34:24.440 obviously M can be bigger and it's
00:34:26.239 easier for me and that's true
00:34:28.440 but you know I've been doing these
00:34:29.879 things for for a long time I just took
00:34:31.879 my son to the Polar Plunge at Lake laner
00:34:34.320 here in Georgia um you know um there's
00:34:37.839 just so much stuff that you could do
00:34:39.359 that again is outside of the
00:34:41.520 norm right you know people think like
00:34:43.719 you don't have to
00:34:45.159 climb Mount Everest to feel like you've
00:34:48.719 accomplished something you have to just
00:34:50.918 get out there and do something that
00:34:52.560 makes you proud of you you know there's
00:34:56.000 a there's a great story uh you do you
00:34:58.560 know ber Brown so she she has this great
00:35:01.960 story she tells about like her daughter
00:35:04.160 going to like a swim meat and she was
00:35:05.680 scared to do like the swim swim beat she
00:35:08.000 was like I'm not going to do well you
00:35:09.960 know I'm scared I'm scared to even just
00:35:11.160 swim blah blah blah and she she talks
00:35:14.240 about how you know her daughter after
00:35:16.560 the swim meat you know she lost the race
00:35:18.280 she maybe got like you know whatever she
00:35:19.680 wasn't didn't do so well she got out she
00:35:21.359 was feeling kind of bummed and BR
00:35:23.440 Brown's quote is like you know winning
00:35:26.160 isn't winning isn't always about getting
00:35:28.000 first place sometimes winning is just
00:35:29.599 getting off the block and getting wet
00:35:31.800 and uh like you know you jumped off the
00:35:33.480 blocks and you got wet like that's a
00:35:35.480 huge win you you you have become a more
00:35:37.520 Brave person by having done that and I
00:35:39.599 think there's uh there's something to
00:35:41.599 that cuz you know when I hear about the
00:35:42.640 Ultramar uh Ultraman races and stuff
00:35:44.720 like that I'm like ah yeah that's a so
00:35:47.200 far from where I am but at the same time
00:35:49.480 when I heard this ber Brown quote about
00:35:51.079 sometimes winning is just getting off
00:35:52.000 the block and getting wet that changed
00:35:53.440 my perspective I started doing a lot
00:35:54.800 more stuff cuz I changed what winning
00:35:56.800 meant also so Sean like I think a lot of
00:35:59.000 people listen to this stuff and they're
00:36:00.119 like oh Jesse's into fitness [ __ ] and
00:36:02.839 you know I'm also into uh I like
00:36:04.599 weightlifting things like that and I
00:36:05.760 think they like say like well I need to
00:36:07.720 go and do a marathon or a long race
00:36:11.319 that's not true I think that you can do
00:36:14.440 things that fit your interest
00:36:15.760 significantly more because like he's got
00:36:17.880 a hat that says all day running running
00:36:19.280 is your passion like I don't think you
00:36:20.640 have to necessarily do something that
00:36:22.200 falls into that endurance category or
00:36:24.040 whatever is popular I want to this year
00:36:27.000 Sam I want to go to one of those silent
00:36:28.599 Retreats where you sit in a dark room
00:36:30.560 for two or three days but listen we're
00:36:33.440 going into a new year all right and I'm
00:36:36.520 giving suggestions and I recognize that
00:36:38.640 everyone is in a different has a
00:36:40.960 different Dynamic time is different
00:36:43.040 finances are different but I what what I
00:36:46.520 love to get out of this call is I just
00:36:48.319 want to fire people up for the
00:36:50.240 opportunity that we all have to have an
00:36:52.720 incredible
00:36:54.040 2025 you know go Master something go
00:36:56.839 learn a language
00:36:58.760 you know go learn a certain skill go
00:37:02.560 volunteer you know do something that
00:37:04.599 makes you proud of yourself at the end
00:37:06.200 of
00:37:07.079 2025 do something that makes you feel
00:37:09.400 accomplished and proud of yourself at
00:37:11.920 2025 now I'm not saying go ride your
00:37:15.040 bike Across America just because I did
00:37:17.280 that no not at all but do something that
00:37:20.599 you look back on the Year and be like
00:37:22.880 this was this was amazing you know and
00:37:25.680 I'm just saying that there's a lot of
00:37:27.040 things that don't cost money if you're
00:37:29.280 intentional if you schedule it which
00:37:32.440 we'll get to in a
00:37:33.680 second and you play a little bit of
00:37:35.800 offense so misoji Kevin's rule the third
00:37:38.760 thing that I do is very simple you know
00:37:41.560 I found this works a lot better for me
00:37:43.000 than New Year's resolutions and maybe
00:37:45.280 maybe different for other people but
00:37:47.680 rather than doing all these goals and
00:37:49.200 stuff which I never accomplish um I very
00:37:52.599 simply every
00:37:54.480 quarter I add a winning habit in my life
00:37:57.920 for so for example like I I don't drink
00:37:59.839 enough water I'm going to drink 100
00:38:02.079 ounces of water you know um as a new
00:38:06.200 habit I'm never GNA be late to a meeting
00:38:08.240 I'm gonna add a 10- minute a day
00:38:09.599 meditation practice you know I I I don't
00:38:12.359 know but like what habit did you add
00:38:14.079 last quarter this is crazy but like I'm
00:38:16.400 so
00:38:17.400 inflexible and I found uh something on
00:38:20.720 YouTube that was like physically
00:38:21.960 inflexible I can't even touch my knees
00:38:24.800 you know so I found something that's
00:38:26.400 like five extra exercises you should do
00:38:28.680 before you have a cup of coffee like
00:38:29.960 first thing you do when you wake up so
00:38:31.440 I've been doing these five stretches it
00:38:33.359 takes six minutes pretty much every day
00:38:36.839 and um I could send you guys the link
00:38:38.480 they're really easy so that but but my
00:38:40.599 point is we we are a product of winning
00:38:44.079 habits winning routines and a winning
00:38:46.720 mindset that's what we all want we want
00:38:48.880 to have winning routines winning habits
00:38:51.960 and a winning mindset and by layering in
00:38:55.560 imagine if you do that let's let's just
00:38:57.119 say we took a fiveyear look on life my
00:38:59.720 life's going to radically change in five
00:39:01.280 years I have a 15-year-old son he'll be
00:39:03.720 at College my my kid my little boys now
00:39:07.240 they're going to be in high school like
00:39:09.520 I like to look at things in fiveyear
00:39:11.119 Windows because you like if your parents
00:39:13.240 are in the are elderly they might not be
00:39:15.839 here in five years like mine mine were
00:39:17.920 five years ago mine aren't now like your
00:39:20.960 life changes freaking like this got to
00:39:24.920 think about this stuff and imagine in
00:39:27.440 five years you just did the three things
00:39:29.040 that I said you had five
00:39:32.400 insane experiences you added 30 manyi
00:39:36.520 Adventures that you wouldn't have had by
00:39:38.319 taking a you know six days of 365 a year
00:39:42.920 I mean come on man and now you added you
00:39:45.920 know you added 20 winning habits you're
00:39:48.280 [ __ ] Jason
00:39:50.040 Bourne you're Jason
00:39:52.319 B and like this is not difficult well so
00:39:56.319 uh all this stuff I'm like this is
00:39:58.240 badass okay tell me how you plan it and
00:40:00.680 how you actually put it in practice
00:40:02.000 you're saying like you're a you're a
00:40:04.800 product of your habits and things like
00:40:06.200 that what's the habit of planning and
00:40:08.119 like thinking of these things and
00:40:09.480 actually getting them on the calendar or
00:40:11.000 whatever so I don't know you know people
00:40:12.800 listening this audio or video but this
00:40:14.240 is my entire 2025 if you're not on
00:40:16.920 YouTube he's holding up the big ass
00:40:18.760 calendar so so I as soon as I know I
00:40:22.760 have something I for me I put it on my
00:40:26.040 on my calendar on paper I write it down
00:40:28.599 now there's a lot of research around
00:40:30.200 writing it down versus putting it in
00:40:31.520 your phone goals that are written down
00:40:33.839 versus you know there's a ton of
00:40:35.280 research around that but as soon as I
00:40:37.560 have any of these trips I put it down I
00:40:40.680 put all my big events for the year down
00:40:42.720 immediately last day of school first day
00:40:44.880 of school if you have kids first day of
00:40:46.720 camp if they go to Camp last day of camp
00:40:48.880 famp spring break trips date nights with
00:40:51.680 my wife every um I take a a quarterly um
00:40:55.240 station or trip with my wife my wife and
00:40:57.920 I have our own little system we have a
00:40:59.680 date night once a week Wednesdays and
00:41:01.920 then every quarter we try to plan
00:41:03.960 something together could be a like we're
00:41:06.160 going to New York next week but it could
00:41:07.960 be just we're gonna have an overnight
00:41:09.560 station here but we try to make sure we
00:41:12.040 have four year date nights as much as we
00:41:15.359 can family dinners and then the rest is
00:41:17.839 just family trips dude you travel a lot
00:41:20.280 I travel a lot but I put it on my
00:41:21.920 calendar because once it's in my
00:41:23.880 calendar now I have permission to say no
00:41:26.920 uh wish I could go to dinner with you
00:41:28.440 guys but I'm actually um I'm camping out
00:41:31.720 with my kids that weekend like now I'm
00:41:34.960 taking control and I'm dominating the
00:41:37.800 year not other people taking it away
00:41:40.599 from me right well you can laugh about
00:41:42.720 it but I'm dead
00:41:44.160 serious I'm laughing because I think
00:41:45.880 it's cool you know that experiment where
00:41:47.359 they take a jar and they're like all
00:41:49.040 right you have these rocks in these sand
00:41:50.599 F put them in the put as much as you can
00:41:52.000 in the jar and basically if you put the
00:41:53.839 sand in first you can't put any of the
00:41:55.440 rocks in right cuz all the little
00:41:56.800 meetings and appointments and zoom calls
00:41:58.440 and everything else takes up all the
00:42:00.359 space versus if you put the rocks in
00:42:01.880 first and then you could pour as much
00:42:03.599 sand will fit all the way around it
00:42:05.480 that's basically kind of like the the
00:42:07.000 model of what you're doing you're
00:42:08.079 basically saying I'm going to put all
00:42:09.400 the [ __ ] I really want to be intentional
00:42:10.640 about the life experiences I'm going to
00:42:11.920 remember with the people I care about
00:42:13.560 I'm going to put those on the calendar
00:42:14.800 first and then I'll let all the little
00:42:16.280 knick-knack appointments fill in around
00:42:18.800 that where there's still space and if I
00:42:20.319 do it the other way like most people do
00:42:22.359 where you say yeah yeah like when I have
00:42:24.280 time then I'm going to do something
00:42:25.400 great and then they never have time and
00:42:26.400 nothing ever happens rocks never get in
00:42:28.400 exactly and the reason why guys I like
00:42:30.760 to have this on one big visual like look
00:42:34.359 at all 365 days on one page the reason
00:42:38.079 why I like to do that is a I'm visual
00:42:41.079 like I need to see it you know we're all
00:42:42.720 we all kind of think in pictures and we
00:42:44.359 think visually but now two two things
00:42:47.880 one I can see where my gaps are I can
00:42:51.559 see where my gaps are where I have more
00:42:54.079 time available and not two I can track
00:42:58.040 towards my goals so much better than
00:43:00.480 versus like if they live you know in my
00:43:02.800 phone and I use my phone for my
00:43:04.720 appointment Zoom calls and all that
00:43:07.000 stuff but I don't like scrolling through
00:43:08.960 it to be like oh my marathon and I'm
00:43:10.400 scrolling all the way to November I like
00:43:12.559 to see it like oh I have this many days
00:43:15.559 it's like the road map is visual so for
00:43:18.520 you know to have it all on one big
00:43:20.480 calendar is is really helpful and I'm
00:43:23.839 super spontaneous you know I know that I
00:43:27.640 look if you don't plan it it probably
00:43:29.720 won't happen so knowing that after being
00:43:33.440 on Earth for five and a half decades
00:43:36.640 what do I do I want to plan as much as I
00:43:38.240 can I want to get in front of it so I
00:43:40.319 sit with my wife We sync up all of our
00:43:42.520 stuff you know in 2025 we're going to
00:43:45.400 like I said I'm going to Finland we have
00:43:47.240 a trip to Japan we're going to Greece
00:43:49.960 you know we we have put all this down on
00:43:52.480 our C my 2025 is already mapped out and
00:43:55.760 it's insane all I have to do is follow
00:43:58.280 the script now yours might not be as as
00:44:02.119 you know wild as mine um but the point
00:44:07.200 is you can troll it and you can map out
00:44:09.839 this incredible year do you but do are
00:44:12.240 you picking those quarterly habits as
00:44:13.800 well as those mini Adventures I'm not
00:44:15.920 I'm not because I'm open I'm always
00:44:17.760 listening to people and and when I was
00:44:20.880 when I had Marquee jet which is a
00:44:22.559 company that I had I started with my
00:44:24.800 partner when I was I don't know 29 30
00:44:27.400 years old um my dad owned the plumbing
00:44:30.559 supply house I had no relationship with
00:44:33.480 money we never talked about it I had no
00:44:36.319 business experience I didn't know [ __ ]
00:44:39.839 and all of a sudden I had this private
00:44:42.240 jet company we're flying 3,000 of the
00:44:45.480 who who of Pop Culture CEOs top CEOs
00:44:49.200 athletes entertainers and I'm getting
00:44:52.359 access to these people and I'm really
00:44:55.800 curious I'm 30 years years old and
00:44:58.200 anytime I had a minute with anybody at
00:45:01.000 the airport if I was visiting a customer
00:45:02.839 client I would say to them like I want
00:45:05.520 to know how they live the rich like you
00:45:07.960 mentioned people here might not be well
00:45:09.720 they might be one day who's going to
00:45:11.400 tell them how to do where do you
00:45:12.760 vacation what do you do with your money
00:45:14.599 what time do you go to bed how many
00:45:15.720 newspapers do you read I want to know it
00:45:17.839 all I want to know the best habits and
00:45:21.079 routines and mindset from the best
00:45:24.440 people on the planet and I became sponge
00:45:28.440 and I remember asking this guy sitting
00:45:30.640 down with this guy I'm not gonna say his
00:45:32.720 first name is James he was insanely
00:45:34.440 wealthy I'm 30 I'm like nothing and I I
00:45:38.119 asked him I said James how do you live
00:45:40.160 rich and he's like he sent to me I read
00:45:42.720 and he you walk me through his through
00:45:44.240 his day and where he vacations and what
00:45:46.359 he does with his money and how much gold
00:45:47.839 he has buried in his backyard and all
00:45:49.480 this [ __ ] never forgot it one thing that
00:45:52.160 he said to me one thing he said to me he
00:45:55.800 goes and I take three hours a day for
00:45:58.720 myself and I'm I can never do that there
00:46:01.520 don't no it's cumulative I'm like well
00:46:03.520 what does that look like you James he
00:46:05.400 like I might take a 30 minute son in the
00:46:07.400 morning I might take a little time at
00:46:09.319 lunch to read go for a walk work out da
00:46:12.599 d da the end of the day it's about three
00:46:14.200 hours a day for myself and I I was like
00:46:17.839 since then I'm like and I was like why
00:46:21.200 and he was like well you know if you
00:46:23.040 check the ubbox you show up as a parent
00:46:26.599 husband been CEO boss employee so much
00:46:30.200 better you don't resent your wife or
00:46:32.240 your husband or your partner for taking
00:46:33.839 away time of the things you want to do
00:46:36.400 all this stuff long story short I
00:46:38.599 started taking two or three hours a day
00:46:41.920 right after that me I'm like they worked
00:46:43.280 for him I'm not gonna wait till I have a
00:46:44.880 bazillion dollars I'm gonna do it now so
00:46:47.800 time Rich something that we talked about
00:46:50.040 earlier doesn't mean you have to be rich
00:46:52.400 to be Tim Rich you have to be organized
00:46:55.400 scheduled and allocated
00:46:57.400 to prioritize you and that's all I'm
00:47:00.119 saying for 2025 you might say Jesse this
00:47:03.200 is Hokey Pokey fine but all I'm telling
00:47:06.000 you is carve out time for you to give
00:47:09.440 you Adventure make you feel com work's
00:47:11.920 always going to be there it's always
00:47:14.000 gonna be there on a week toe basis do do
00:47:17.119 you make a list of your to-dos for the
00:47:19.319 week before yeah so um I look at my week
00:47:23.800 on Sunday night I take it from my
00:47:27.200 calendar and from my phone and I put it
00:47:29.520 on paper I use a planner but you can
00:47:32.359 also just write a piece of paper and I
00:47:33.920 write down my day it's like I can move
00:47:35.839 things around and then I can prepare
00:47:37.480 better I know it's I like to have a weak
00:47:39.640 at a glance view of everything and then
00:47:42.480 and then the last thing I would say this
00:47:44.440 is L like a little bonus thought for
00:47:46.559 people is remember when you were a kid
00:47:48.920 and I don't know if your parents gave
00:47:50.160 you vitamins did they give you vitamins
00:47:52.079 when you were a kid like four School
00:47:53.319 Flintstones Vitamins for sure yeah
00:47:54.720 Flintstones right I Flintstones Vitamins
00:47:57.760 as a
00:47:58.640 kid anti Flinstone vitamins but that's
00:48:01.960 that's that'll be podcast number three
00:48:04.319 the the the the vitamins were like you
00:48:07.000 know you take one vitamin and it had
00:48:09.480 like you 500% of everything you needed
00:48:13.440 in every category in like one little
00:48:15.400 pill and I that's unbelievable but you
00:48:17.920 know you took your daily vitamins and it
00:48:19.280 checked all the boxes so I have my own
00:48:22.040 version of this that I do Sam um and
00:48:24.720 Sean that that works really well so like
00:48:27.200 if you made a list imagine you all the
00:48:29.920 time in the world you could do whatever
00:48:31.280 you wanted to do every day what how
00:48:33.800 would you spend your day well I know
00:48:35.559 exactly what I would want to do I love
00:48:37.280 saunas I love coal plunges I love
00:48:39.640 running biking swimming and exercise I
00:48:42.359 love doing breath work I love taking
00:48:43.920 walks with my wife I love playing with
00:48:45.400 my kids like I'm very clear on what it
00:48:48.839 is by the way no where I say do I say I
00:48:51.000 love buying art but I don't those are
00:48:53.960 the things I love to do they're very
00:48:56.160 simple I inherited that from a very
00:48:58.319 simple man my
00:49:00.680 dad the let's say I have 10 of those
00:49:03.359 things on my list okay those are my
00:49:05.880 vitamins those are the things that make
00:49:07.440 me strong that I need every day I try to
00:49:11.280 do two take two or three of those
00:49:13.040 vitamins I can't do them all but I I try
00:49:17.160 to do two or three so today it's we're
00:49:19.760 recording this now it's one o'clock but
00:49:21.799 I've already gone for an hour run and
00:49:24.319 I've taken an hour sauna so of the three
00:49:26.880 hours I allocate for
00:49:28.720 myself I've already done about two of
00:49:30.920 them so like my day is good and I've
00:49:32.760 taken two of my vitamins so now when I
00:49:34.880 show up for you guys I'm all in I'm not
00:49:38.160 Outsourcing like we talked about I'm all
00:49:40.559 in you know because I checked me I'm
00:49:43.720 showing up so much better that is so
00:49:46.400 fraking important and that's every day
00:49:48.880 for me this is amazing um this is
00:49:51.680 awesome is there before I ask you my my
00:49:54.640 kind of I have one burning question
00:49:56.680 before I ask you my burning question is
00:49:57.760 there anything else in the planning how
00:49:59.359 to make a kickass defining 2025 is there
00:50:02.119 anything else we miss before we do that
00:50:03.599 uh do that or were those the big ones I
00:50:05.480 think at like a high level trying to get
00:50:08.280 people to rethink how they approach the
00:50:11.480 new year I think that you know just get
00:50:15.160 started on those things I mean you might
00:50:16.760 not have it all laid out I don't have it
00:50:18.880 all laid out yet but put the stuff you
00:50:21.119 want to do down first on a calendar or
00:50:24.280 wherever you want to put it and build
00:50:27.520 a year that you're super proud of
00:50:30.559 because let me let me just say this Sean
00:50:33.799 we don't get a lot of
00:50:36.160 years we don't get a lot of years and we
00:50:39.520 don't know how many years we're going to
00:50:40.880 get so shame on you if you waste
00:50:44.079 2025 because you want to like oh I'll
00:50:46.720 just do it NE the following year don't
00:50:48.359 like time doesn't work like that you
00:50:50.760 don't have the luxury of like you don't
00:50:53.880 dictate the
00:50:55.319 pace sometimes the pace dictates you and
00:51:00.079 circumstances change and like you know
00:51:02.960 everyone thinks like I guarantee you
00:51:05.920 everybody here knows they're gon to die
00:51:07.799 that's listening to this but I guarantee
00:51:10.400 less than 1% of our listeners have their
00:51:12.359 graveyard plot picked out because they
00:51:14.920 don't think they're gonna die anytime
00:51:16.319 soon they don't think that like your
00:51:18.520 life could change like that my life's
00:51:20.359 been turned upside down I have people
00:51:22.440 that my friends are getting diagnosed
00:51:23.920 with [ __ ] you know like it changes man
00:51:27.000 you can go outside and someone could be
00:51:28.559 texting and you get smacked it just it
00:51:32.640 could go like that you don't know so you
00:51:35.839 know I'm 56 years old the average
00:51:38.480 American lives to be
00:51:40.359 78 I don't know I'm not really good at
00:51:43.599 math but that's 22 years if I'm average
00:51:48.079 and you know I was on a lake this summer
00:51:50.720 I didn't see a lot of 78y old guys
00:51:52.839 weight boarding like the the years that
00:51:55.680 you have to do an Ultram man what do
00:51:57.799 they say um I was just listening to
00:51:59.839 something they said what 63 is the shelf
00:52:02.520 life of like healthy years or something
00:52:05.720 you know like it's insane so you it's
00:52:09.040 also insane that you plan these you like
00:52:11.280 well I'll get to it when I'm older but
00:52:13.319 then when you're older it's like I don't
00:52:14.319 want to [ __ ] do that you know what I
00:52:15.680 mean like uh you know I've always
00:52:17.920 criticized actually waren Buffett where
00:52:19.240 he talks about like delayed
00:52:20.079 gratification and things like this and
00:52:21.359 I'm like dude you you've been the man
00:52:23.119 for years like you enjoy it enjoy that
00:52:25.359 [ __ ] now like sometimes p
00:52:27.480 time rich man you don't have to be rich

00:52:31.720 of viral this this year last year die
00:52:33.760 with zero talks about some of these
00:52:35.359 principles but he has this great story
00:52:36.720 about one of them that he was talking
00:52:38.200 about when he was in his 20s and he was
00:52:39.400 on his career ladder climb and he was at
00:52:41.280 some Investment Bank and his buddy we
00:52:43.559 worked with him they were kind of both
00:52:44.680 23 years old or whatever was like hey

00:52:52.920 quit and like I hope I'll be able to get
00:52:54.400 the job when I come back but like I'm
00:52:55.799 going to do this
00:52:57.240 and he was like dude you're crazy that's
00:52:58.440 like irresponsible I'm going to do the
00:52:59.960 responsible thing and he didn't do that
00:53:02.440 and he's he told himself he would do it
00:53:03.760 you know maybe next year or the year
00:53:05.000 after that maybe some some reason he'd
00:53:06.920 be able to do it in the future so you
00:53:08.640 know he's like as soon as he sh came
00:53:10.480 back after six weeks he didn't have the
00:53:11.960 job back but he he met up with the guy
00:53:13.640 he's like from the glow on this dude's
00:53:15.359 face I realized then I made a mistake he
00:53:17.920 talks about how when he was 33 then 10
00:53:19.920 years later he finally like took a
00:53:21.720 career break and he's like went to
00:53:23.160 Europe he's like it's not so cool
00:53:25.160 sleeping in a hostel when you're 33 um
00:53:27.920 you know it's a different he's like I
00:53:29.319 learned that some things you can't even
00:53:31.119 just it's not even just doing them later
00:53:32.400 is worse he's like it's just not the
00:53:34.160 same thing like that's a 23y old trip I
00:53:36.480 didn't do it when I was 23 I did it when
00:53:38.319 I was 33 or 34 and I had to have a whole
00:53:41.040 different experience there was no going
00:53:42.559 back to that I think it's really
00:53:44.359 important to say yes to Adventure and um
00:53:47.359 it's never the right time you know like
00:53:50.079 it's never going to be like oh I have
00:53:51.480 eight days that are clean you have to
00:53:53.599 make it you have to create that you know
00:53:55.920 I think that's really important message
00:53:57.680 like it's never the right time you're
00:53:59.520 always I'm going to miss the basketball
00:54:01.160 game you know there's always a sacrifice
