all right it's the end of the year and forget New Year's resolutions we have something much better so in the next hour Jesse ller is coming on and he has a entire process for planning a monster 2025 I don't want to play catchup I want to attack like now I'm taking control and I'm dominating the year not other people taking it away from me Jesse is a incredibly successful guy he started ziko coconut water he started a private jet company he sold to Warren Buffett he's an Emmy award-winning rapper got four kids he's an ultramarathon or he lived with David goggin if you don't want to learn from this guy
something's wrong with you you're broken inside if everybody does the three things that we're going to talk about in 2025 and does everything else the same at the end of the year if they see me in an airport they're going to bear hug
I saw Sean writing like I like take notes these are my golden nuggets from this episode
These are you know my pen dive halfway through and now you added 20 winning habits you're Jason borne you're decent board Jesse is amazing he tells us this process that he's been doing for the past 25 30 years I'm pretty pumped about it
and I think you will be too I'm glad to be back man I love your show I love that you got me back as a repeat as a repeat offender so let me just start by saying that you know I love December I think December and January is are critical months for the 11 or 12 months that follow them and as we head into the new year you know the first thing that I do like any business in America when we get to the end of the year they close out the year they have review sessions what worked what didn't work you know what was successful what wasn't successful they give thems a grade Etc
and I found that um a lot of people don't do that in their own personal life so I like to take a little inventory in December and just kind of have a little review process around how the year went and and and take inventory on my own personal year but like no one taught me how to set up my life you know like no one taught me how to like deal with my emails and no one taught me how to schedule properly I never like I didn't take a class in school that like hey you're gonna have four kids you're gonna get bombarded with emails from from the school with all kinds of appointments and zoom calls that we didn't have back then and you know your calendar is going to fill up with other people's requests for your time like how do you want to deal with that
so you have enough time to do things that you want to do and achieve the goals that you want to do within work and outside of work no one taught me that and then layer in children and layer in a wife that works in a business as an entrepreneur and like how do you do that
so you know like I'm a product of trial and era I tried a lot of stuff I didn't grow up with a phone I was scheduling everything on a paper calendar for literally 45 years of my life um you know and um
and I had a figure out like what as my life ebol how to grow with it
so I have a pretty cool system I'm happy to share it with you guys it's worked really well it's allowed me to to balance a lot of things and get a lot of things done
and I think it's pretty simple
and I will preface it by saying that um you know as you get older how old are you guys 35 and 36 right
yeah six all right so you got another maybe decade before this hits but it will hit and it's inevitable as you get older creating newness becomes really hard because you live in routine you know and like it gets very comfortable to be to live in routine and really I found that the only way to really guarantee that you create newness and newness is important it's important to relationships it's important to your momentum and your enthusiasm and your success and your excitement towards thing and your growth the only way to create newness I found is the planet and or leave room to be spontaneous
so I become a really aggressive planner and I feel like a lot of us played um life on defense our calendars fill up with other people's requests for time like I mentioned Zoom calls weddings appointments school stuff and at the end of the year like you don't have a lot to show for it what are the categories I do Family Fitness Finance fun do you have like your own like cute acronym uh for your categories well I do my own individual personal audits for business with my teams but then from my personal thing Adventure is a category for me I try to look through like what kind of Adventures did I have like I said
and we'll get into this in a minute you know you want to have something to show for all your hard work at the end of the year not your Zoom calls
I'm not like yes in October I lit it up on Zoom I'm not doing that I'm like
oh just I just took a one-on-one trip with my daughter to New York City I just got back so stuff like that
I'm like really taking inventory on how much time did I spend with my kids you know what did I do well what I do what I have to work on in my like I really really do do that
and then I try to close out the year and I have a system for closing out the year I'll share it with you guys really quickly and like the overall theme of closing out a year and I think everyone should take a couple hours to do this I think it builds momentum and I think it gives you a little closure around the year whether you had a great year or a bad year it gives you a fresh start for 2025 which I think is is really really important and um the theme is I want to come into the new year light I want to feel light and I want to get rid of all the email baggage all the to-do list all this I don't want to have a lot of carryover going into the new year I want to kind of clean my hands and just be light now this might sound ridiculous it starts in my closet I go through my closet I look at all the stuff that's been hanging there for 12 months that I've never worn you know and I donate it
I get a big bag if if anything is a 5050 do I want to keep it or don't want to keep it I just say someone needs this more than me it goes in the Donate box
and I start to organize my closet so when I walk in I don't have a ton of decisions you might see me wearing very a shirts very similar to this because I don't have a lot of options you know I keep what I like I get rid of what I don't like and I get super clean my desk I get rid of all the Clutter on my desk
I want I don't want to walk in
and I got stacks of things I got to go through and bills and stuff I get super clean on my desk my emails
I'm a big hit delete and explode them all at the end of the year guy um
but before I do that I put things in files I respond to the things that I owe an answer to I delete the stuff that I don't need everything else goes into a folder and I try to go in Net Zero into 2025 that's really important I don't want to come back back from my vacation January 1 and be sitting with an inbox with 700 emails and just like you know just feel like I have to play catchup the first 30 days of the year I don't want to play catchup I want to attack I want to attack so I come in I come in naked on my emails I unsubscribe I go through all the stuff that I have subscriptions to I unsubscribe I un
I delete all the apps that I use again just trying to get light you know I get rid of all clear out all the apps I clear out my cars make sure that you know have no clutter in there and um I create files for 20125 where you know
maybe I I'm still a paper guy
so I keep records of my medical files I know people have them on digitally but I keep a paper file I still get my bills paper I put them in files
so but again
I I have a system
so I'm not like playing catchup
and um so I come I get super light on all that stuff
and then I can't recommend this enough I write handwritten letters to the 20 to 30 people that really impacted me or helped me even you guys man having me on you know you might get a thank you note thank there 8 billion people in the world guys thank you too for having me on your podcast like you thought of me thank you
I write I write in you know a handwritten letter to my suppliers my contractors maybe a teacher my son's coaches for football I want to thank them this year you know um with no purpose other than really giving like a thank you
I've been doing this about that for 30 years when I was 23 years old and I had no money
and I was sleeping on 18 different couches my entire marketing strategy was I wrote 10 handwritten letters a day
and I mailed I wrote 3,000 letters I'm not even kidding and I still to this day do that because it breaks through the Clutter people remember it people read their mail they might not read their DMS text slacks and all that stuff but they read their letters that come in the mail and there's a different intention I took the time I wrote it I licked the envelope I went to the mailbox I put a stamp on it I put it in there like it comes with a lot of love man is a lot different than hitting send on an email are you still doing are you still doing all that
or I'm not gonna talk about anything I don't do no what I meant is uh I've like wanted to send email uh letters to a lot of people and then I'll be like but is there a service where I can just type it out and they mail it out for me
yeah it doesn't work that way he's like are you listening no
I I the audio coming through I do it by the way I send letters as well
but then I like have a stack I have like um a few years ago I got some stationary and it like feels good to like write letters to people but every once in a while I'm like I don't feel like writing this is there a service
and then I'm like what the hell am I doing
and so I wasn't sure you're doing
yeah you can't Outsource it you can't Outsource it you know um as a business owner like I've realized that you can't Outsource Soul you know and the DNA of a business is the soul of the business the heartbeat of a business you can't Outsource that and customers feel soul and your friends feel soul and when you start Outsourcing things that you know for hundreds of years humans have been doing themselves it loses a little bit
and I found that that twoh hour investment how about this let's do an experiment for your listeners take 10 envelopes 10 take 10 pieces of paper and take 20 minutes and write a thank you note or to your parents to your kids teachers whoever saying hey this year I just want to thank you for investing so much time with my kids or whatever you want to write lick the stamp put in an envelope and watch the return on investment watch the return on investment
and I found that um there's nothing like quite like it now that might sound ridiculous hokey but I've been do it for 30 years and people still thank me no one gets a letter from you like that and doesn't remember or hit you back uh there was a guy who came on by the way and he held up he was he does the same thing uh this guy gu spear he's value investor
and he held up he goes I do this
but he's like why did I start because I went to um The Berkshire hathway Summit
and I went to this event and then he goes afterwards here's what I got in the mail it was a letter Warren Buffett had written him a letter it was two seconds it was guy thank you for coming really appreciate you being there sign Warren and he goes if Warren Buffett is doing this I can do this too
I get one from Coach K
I know you're a Duke guy I get one from Coach K every year check this out look at this let show you guys something this all of these letters all of these letters and there's I have boxes of these all of these letters check this out these are all letters that I got this year I've read them all I keep them all in this box and at the end of the year it's going in a thing
and then I'm starting a new box that's gonna say 2025 because I've been talking about this for a long time
and um you know I'm in a really unique spot I'm in a business where people write me letters you want to talk about finding your mission imagine waking up going to your mailbox and and and to to letters of people thanking you for you know sharing best practices or you know helping whatever it is what a what a gift right what a freaking gift if if everybody does the three things that we're GNA talk about in the next 20 minutes in 2025 and does everything else the same that they did in 2024 at the end of the year if they see me in an airport they're going to be hug me because they're going to be like that was so easy
and I can't believe how much better my life just got that's what we're going to cover hey guys so a huge part of the growth of this podcast is thanks to our presence on YouTube and without YouTube
I don't think we'd be as big as we are now
and it's all because of you guys for watching we see you in the comments even the negative ones it def really bothers me but I read all of them
and we see how powerful this platform is for growing an audience well if you're planning for the next year and you're thinking about investing in a YouTube strategy for your business then you have to check out this new guide from HubSpot it covers everything you need so building a Content strategy it covers understanding the YouTube algorithm and how to leverage SEO tactics and then it also talks about the different content types and examples to create engaging content so don't miss out grab the guide and set yourself up for success next year now let's get back to the episode
so the first thing is is closing out the year getting light doing all those things you know to get light writing handwritten letters and then the the other thing that I do is I I try to identify like what I want to fix going into next year because you know like everybody wants to be a 10 out of 10 no one signed up to be an 8 out of 10 the 80 you know a B minus everybody wants to be as close to they a 10 out of 10 but if you have certain things that are broken even if you make a bazillion dollars and your business goes up 50% and your crazy growth you're never going to be a 10 out of 10 if like the marriage is broken you know something is wrong
whatever so what I always tell people to do is imagine you guys had you guys can do this right now imagine you had a big blender and in the blender you put all the buckets Sam that you were just talking about all the buckets in your life into the blender your finances your health your weight your relationships where you live like everything going on in your life put it in a blender shake it up and then on a one to 10 with 10 being like the ultimate in happiness and one being Rock Bottom like again what's your number your weight your relationships your work your finances you put it all in your shake are you a seven are you a five you don't have to tell me are you an eight are you what like what are you now what I love about that exercise is immediately your brain goes to a 10 and then the two or three things that are bothering you pop in your head like crystal clear and take that number down
so maybe it was like
oh my finances aren't there
or like I hate my job or things aren't great in my whatever came into your head those are the things you got to work on they're not going to magically get better like you don't just like oh you know like my my relationship stinks it just like magically get better you got to work on it and did anything pop into your guys head right away
so I I put it all in the blender I got to an eight and a half and right away you're you're right I started at a 10: because I'm I'm happy right
and then I said well I do the weight's got to come down a little bit all right the weight's got to come down a little bit so that's that's a point off you're not I want to have healthy habits that I'm proud of
and then the second one was um you know
I I think I'm really good at this content thing I love making content
but I'm still spending way too much of my time in my business is
and I I really want to make that shift from operator to Creator and i' i' made I've made good progress
but I'm not all the way where I want to be there I had a six I had a daughter
and I'm loving being a father
and she's fantastic that's a 10 finances I did
really well that's a 10
but I'm bombarded with inbound messages and I don't have a system to where I'm saying no to 10 minutes at a time uh the 10-minute time requests and contact switching is ruining my life it feels like I can't get in the flow
so I'm going to give my give it a six okay a six overall
because the context switching it like I get so much joy being in the flow of something and I both a combination of lack of system and addiction to social media and text and all that it's brought me down a whole bunch you know two thoughts one when you're doing the exercise there's no comparison against anybody else
so like you know if you are comfortable with the money you're making or whatever you're not comparing yourself to Buffet it's like you know I'm comfortable where I am you're never going to win the comparison game because there's always gonna be someone so that's one thing just to think about
and then you know not to knock you at all
Sam I think that was super honest of you but like for anybody out there that was a six if like if my son comes home with a 60 on a test it's an F
but I'm agreeing with you like it it
it brought me down a lot but the good thing is it's all fixable and you have to identify it and like look I'm not here to be a therapist or preach all I'm saying is knowing what those things that are that need a little bit of help and if it's your weight you know then just in 2025 be like you know what man everything's clicking I'm gonna address this I'm just GNA be a little that's all you know
but but you have to my point is for the listener like you got to identify it because if you don't it just keeps compounding and and then you're playing it's just harder to like catch up when it's compounding so you close out the year you get light you clean the closet clean the desk clean the cars you email bankruptcy you get the files you write the handwritten letters you give thanks you do the blender exercise you identify the two or three shifts I'm trying to make that is that clo is that how you close out the year or is there anything else to that a personal review and just to make it super practical are you like writing this down are you just thinking about it do you say it out loud do you do this with somebody else do you look at your calendar how do you even go back through the could you just give us like if I wanted to say down an hour after this cuz I'm so pumped after this episode I wanted to go do this can you just give me the like kind of the a little more detailed instruction on how I would do it
I get really excited about getting light like you know so I don't have to write anything down to clean up clean my closet and my desk and my emails like that's all just something that like you know you feel accomplished when you do that
and we're doing all the other stuff
anyway we're we're we have businesses we're doing all this
but you just feel really good about yourself as far as like handwritten letters I do make a list I keep it every year of like kind of just man I just think about like what podcast were I on for me was I on who really went above and beyond for me this year or my kids or my family you know I had a I went on a trip to to Africa we had a great tour guide um I had a gentleman in Kenya that ran with me every day to to like chaperon me through the jungle I'm GNA understand him and like just that kind of stuff and I don't want anything for it just makes me feel good and I know it probably makes them feel good
so I do all that
and then I and then like again you just took that exercise took 30 seconds to identify what we got to work on and then I just make a me a mental note about it like you know I want to get better at it this whole process we're talking about it's like super fast all right
so that's the first thing the second thing I do is I have a planning system that I've been using that
I swear by it's there's three steps and this is what I was talking about if you do these three things you going to bear hug me very simple
so the first thing that I do is um there's an old Japanese ritual called the misogi and we took we took the liberty to tweak the exact definition of it it
but but the way we look at it is that the the concept around a misogi is every year you do one big year defining thing so again at the end of the the year even though you're busy with all this stuff you have one year defining thing thing that to really show for your time over the 365 so for example like two years ago and this is big I rode my bike Across America last year I did rim to rim to rim with some friends in 2015
I launched a book living with the seal 2017 I launched a company called 2929 like every year going back literally like you know 20 years ago I can name like the one thing that I did that was really really year Define so at the beginning of the year I just I might not have that idea and that could be like I'm going to launch a podcast I'm going to quit smoking I'm going to run my first marathon you know but like what is that one thing that you're gonna look back to someone says was your I was unbelievable man I roll my freaking bike across the country I ran the New York Marathon this year you know I think that's really really important now a it's important because like you want to have somebody to show for it
but D um I find when you have something on the calendar a goal something like that you're something that you're working towards um that's challenging you you show up at work and
at home completely different you show up completely different a if I'm running a New York Marathon Sam I now have to say no to the things that that I don't have the time to give people because I got to train I'm adding you know hours of training in
so not now you have a vehicle to say no to things but B you know have something that you're looking forward to one of the books that I read this last year I think it was Michael something uh Easter maybe uh the Comfort crisis and he talked about the misogi I had one it was a 50- mile race and the the the Mogi was uh you have a 50% chance of failing uh I ended up uh uh hurting my achilles really badly and I was like
I I failed uh and it was awesome though have something look forward I'm picking a new one now um
but you didn't fail Sam you just didn't finish
but it was hard ass work and it was awesome it felt great to have that on the calendar
but what you did was amazing you're saying I'm gonna go double the longest run I've ever done in my life I'm gonna do an ultramarathon on top of everything I I have going on I'm gonna challenge myself it may or may not work that that's not an F I mean that's an a an adventure you just didn't finish it
I mean not everything we do is going to work I've had businesses that have failed races that I have dnfs
but I love that you put it on your calendar look my kids I have four kids 15 10 10 and nine
all right you know what they're talking about right now they're talking about that we're going skiing in two weeks so they're going to school and I'm like guys two more weeks of school then we're going skiing because that's on their calendar it's helping them go through school focused lock in because they know they're going to get this reward winter vacation coming up adults are the same way like I'm willing to go work really hard if I know I have a vacation coming up or a race that I'm gonna do or something that I'm excited about so having one big year defining thing really important do you know what yours is going to be for 25
I don't I don't and that's okay but I know that I'm gonna have one and what it does is it also like opens up my mind to Adventure which Mogi do you look back out on most fondly uh if you look back you know 10 years or
so I did a race called Ultram man which is a 6.2 mile Open Water Swim a 275 mile bike and a 52 mile run
and I I I was insanely I was going to defer to the following year two weeks before the race because I didn't I had swam at all
I I didn't I didn't have a wet suit and the water was 57 degree
so I called it my friend who's a coach and I'm like you know listen
I haven't been training at all zero and there's no
I don't think I can do this and I'm thinking about deferring thinking he's going to be like of course defer train so you don't get hurt
and he was like absolutely not the challenge is going to be you know if you train for a year you're gonna be able to do it you have no idea if you're going to do it dude a six a six mile swim alone would take like three and a half hours right or if you're a bad swimmer like me
but yeah
and also like 57 degree Waters is I
I did a a marathon 57 degre it was horrible or Tron it was awful
I showed up at the event and I jumped into the water the day before and my I I literally like my face hit the water and it was like you're like I'm out out
I'm done it's like it's like it's like getting punched in the nose like for the first time when you want a box you're like this sucks dude I don't I don't to do this
but I finished it
I finished it
and um you know when I was going through this event those th those kind of challenges it's really important to break things into digestible bikes if you're starting a business you want to put things into digestible bikes so when I started Marquee jaet if they would have said you need FAA approval Department of Transportation approval build a sales team raise my
I like I'm was a kidy pool attendant for you what are you talking about I mean what what did you say the first thing I needed was FAA approval
well there's got to be a lawyer that does that specializes in that let me get got that guy got what was the second thing we need
like so it was the same thing here I got to swim 10 six miles impossible can I swim to that to the next to the buoy yes can I swim buoy to buoy
yes so let me just break this down into 40 buoy to buoy swins because I can let me break the I can run for seven minutes forever so let me run for seven minutes walk for three and just repeat that cycle and that that's sort of how I attacked it in any event we pick a Mogi all right
so I don't know what mine is yet Sean for next year
but I know I'm gonna have one and just for the listeners you know just the notion of like yeah you know what I want to have something on my calendar now you like you've like reprogrammed your brain to just be aware of Adventure and that's already a step in the right direction if you're head down in work the second thing I do is something that I've named after my friend Kevin
I call it Kevin's rule Kevin and I were took our our children his daughter and my son my son was eight at the time I think his daughter was nine to Mount Washington in the winter it was it was like minus 30 with the windshield and we have a minus 40 sleeping bag we're sleeping in the snow it's insane and we're camping out overnight
and I'm like Kevin he's a police officer in New York
I'm like there's eight billion people in the world we're the only four people in the middle of Mount Washington man this is amazing
I'm like you know how often do you do stuff like this and he lights up he's like oh he's like every other month I do something one day or one weekend that I normally wouldn't have done I'm like what are you talking about he's like
oh instead of like watching the Georgia football game I'll take my kids fishing
I'll come to Mt one house go visit my my college friends I'm like
well why he goes well if I can't take one day every eight weeks to do something like my work life is is at is out of balance
but if I do that I'll have six little Min Adventures a year I'm like
yeah he's like
well how H how old are you well if you're 35 Sean you live to be let's say you live to be 85 that's 50 years if you do those two things I just said you'll have 50 year defining things and 300 mini Adventures that's an insane life that's an insane life at the end of the day if I have 50 Ultram man kind of things and 300 mini Adventures just because I managed my clock right like I won life do your mini adventures and your M like do they stack to where it's like
well I already did the Ultra Man what's like the ultra Ultra Man like are you trying to one up them each time not at all
I'm just looking for things that that excite me um so this actually this year I do have a it's not challenging enough for me to consider it like a misogi
but I'm going on a a tour of the world's best saas in Finland with 12 friends so we're going for 10 days we're hitting 30 30 plus saunas over the course of 12 Days in in in Finland
and you know so that is my a big thing for 2025 hey real quick if you're liking this episode with Jesse you got to listen to the first one we did with him it's a story of how he built his fortune his first business how he failed and then ultimately a mentor stepped in and gave him some some tough love let's say and turned his life around uh he tells a story about how he started a private jet company ended up selling that to Warren Buffett there's a Matt Damon cameo in it crazy stories from this guy he also brainstormed business ideas of what he would do if he was young and needed to build a fortune from scratch again so go check that out it's episode number 504 you can either Google it or in the show notes below we're going to put a link to it and also at the end of this episode we are giving away a few thousand dolls of his big ass calendar the one that he uses to plan his 2025 we say the code at the end of this episode so listen to that and then you can go and get one of those for free all right back to the episode
so if I'm getting this right the misogi is more of a challenge something that excites you something that it's a big adventure it's year defining and you have the you'll get the fun of progress along the way as you make progress you'll get the anticipation and then you'll get the year defining a sense of accomplishment whether you win or just you did it um
and then the adventures are more about is that just more about non- routine so just kind of making sure you are not just every Saturday we go here every Sunday we do this with my kids and just shaking up the routine with something fun it doesn't have to be super challenging but is that the right way to think about those absolutely it's it's non routine it's planning Adventure planning newness it's prioritizing yourself and it's not it's it's playing life on offense it's not letting your calendar fill up you know look if we just sit back it's going to be weddings meetings conferences appointments and just like what are we do what are we doing how many of those things are uh Jessie by himself or with buddies or Jessie like the family um I love I love to do things with with my friends I love to do things with my family I treat my family stuff differently
so I also plan family trips but you know um I have the luxury of time you know people talk about rich and and the first thing that comes into your head is like money obviously and that is important and clearly that's an important part of being rich but there are so many buckets of Rich are you spiritually Rich
are you time
Rich I'm insanely Tim Rich right now which I think is the most important thing especially in your 50s I'm insanely Tim Rich
so I can I have the luxury of doing things spontaneously when I want Etc I'm
spiritually Rich I'm socially Rich if we did a little sidebar here because the three of us are all lucky to be in a a position where we don't have to work we could all we could just spend all year training for you know an MMA fight an amateur MMA fight or whatever it is
but I think a lot of people who listen to that you know may not be at that you know they still have the job they still have whatever the the you know the day-to-day responsibilities so could you take you know 30 seconds to sort of speak to like how you would maybe is there any difference in how you would approach it you know the Mogi or the adventures if somebody's not like you know financially free where their their calendar is Theirs to do whatever they want with listen I have been doing this since my journey was insane it was crazy my 20s were were spent on couches friends you know um just trying to like figure it out pay my rent you know all that stuff
but I was still so rich with Adventure every year I would go to the Coney Island Polar Plunge on New Year's you know what it cost a subway token subway token
you know what it cost to do the trip to Mount Washington with my kids $18 to park we live in a country that offers the most insane rivers mountains national parks oceans hikes strings I mean conferences like you could fill up your life with Adventure I should write a book filling up your life on adventure you know for under $400 a year because you can do it now
so you know
I I understand that obviously M can be bigger and it's easier for me and that's true
but you know I've been doing these things for for a long time I just took my son to the Polar Plunge at Lake laner here in Georgia um you know um there's just so much stuff that you could do that again is outside of the norm
right you know people think like you don't have to climb Mount Everest to feel like you've accomplished something you have to just get out there and do something that makes you proud of you you know there's a there's a great story uh you do you know ber Brown
so she she has this great story she tells about like her daughter going to like a swim meat
and she was scared to do like the swim swim beat she was like I'm not going to do well you know I'm scared I'm scared to even just swim blah
blah blah
and she she talks about how you know her daughter after the swim meat you know she lost the race she maybe got like you know whatever she wasn't didn't do so well she got out she was feeling kind of bummed and BR Brown's quote is like you know winning isn't winning isn't always about getting first place sometimes winning is just getting off the block and getting wet and uh like you know you jumped off the blocks and you got wet like that's a huge win
you you you have become a more Brave person by having done that and I think there's uh there's something to that cuz you know when I hear about the Ultramar uh Ultraman races and stuff like that I'm like ah yeah
that's a so far from where I am but at the same time when I heard this ber Brown quote about sometimes winning is just getting off the block and getting wet that changed my perspective I started doing a lot more stuff cuz I changed what winning meant also so Sean
like I think a lot of people listen to this stuff and they're like oh Jesse's into fitness and you know I'm also into uh I like weightlifting things like that and I think they like say like well I need to go and do a marathon or a long race that's not true I think that you can do things that fit your interest significantly more because like he's got a hat that says all day running running is your passion like I don't think you have to necessarily do something that falls into that endurance category or whatever is popular I want to this year
Sam I want to go to one of those silent Retreats where you sit in a dark room for two or three days but listen we're going into a new year all right
and I'm giving suggestions and I recognize that everyone is in a different has a different Dynamic time is different finances are different
but I what what I love to get out of this call is I just want to fire people up for the opportunity that we all have to have an incredible 2025 you know go Master something go learn a language you know go learn a certain skill go volunteer
you know do something that makes you proud of yourself at the end of 2025 do something that makes you feel accomplished and proud of yourself at 2025 now I'm not saying go ride your bike Across America just because I did that no not at all but do something that you look back on the Year and be like this was this was amazing you know
and I'm just saying that there's a lot of things that don't cost money if you're intentional if you schedule it which we'll get to in a second
and you play a little bit of offense so misoji Kevin's rule the third thing that I do is very simple you know I found this works a lot better for me than New Year's resolutions and maybe maybe different for other people but rather than doing all these goals and stuff which I never accomplish um I very simply every quarter I add a winning habit in my life for so for example like I I don't drink enough water I'm going to drink 100 ounces of water you know um as a new habit I'm never GNA be late to a meeting I'm gonna add a 10- minute a day meditation practice you know
I I don't know
but like what habit did you add last quarter this is crazy
but like I'm so inflexible and I found uh something on YouTube that was like physically inflexible I can't even touch my knees you know so I found something that's like five extra exercises you should do before you have a cup of coffee like first thing you do when you wake up so I've been doing these five stretches it takes six minutes pretty much every day and um I could send you guys the link they're really easy so that
but but my point is we we are a product of winning habits winning routines and a winning mindset that's what we all want we want to have winning routines winning habits and a winning mindset and by layering in imagine if you do that let's let's just say we took a fiveyear look on life my life's going to radically change in five years I have a 15-year-old son he'll be at College my my kid my little boys now they're going to be in high school like I like to look at things in fiveyear Windows because you like if your parents are in the are elderly they might not be here in five years like mine mine were five years ago mine aren't now like your life changes freaking like this got to think about this stuff and imagine in five years you just did the three things that I said you had five insane experiences you added 30 manyi Adventures that you wouldn't have had by taking a you know six days of 365 a year I mean come on man
and now you added you know you added 20 winning habits you're Jason Bourne you're Jason B and like this is not difficult
well so uh all this stuff I'm like this is badass okay tell me how you plan it and how you actually put it in practice you're saying like you're a you're a product of your habits and things like that what's the habit of planning and like thinking of these things and actually getting them on the calendar or whatever
so I don't know you know people listening this audio or video but this is my entire 2025 if you're not on YouTube he's holding up the big ass calendar
so so
I as soon as I know I have something I for me I put it on my on my calendar on paper I write it down now there's a lot of research around writing it down versus putting it in your phone goals that are written down versus you know there's a ton of research around that but as soon as I have any of these trips I put it down I put all my big events for the year down immediately last day of school first day of school if you have kids first day of camp if they go to Camp last day of camp famp spring break trips date nights with my wife every um I take a a quarterly um station or trip with my wife my wife and I have our own little system we have a date night once a week Wednesdays and then every quarter we try to plan something together could be a like we're going to New York next week
but it could be just we're gonna have an overnight station here but we try to make sure we have four year date nights as much as we can family dinners and then the rest is just family trips dude you travel a lot I travel a lot
but I put it on my calendar because once it's in my calendar now I have permission to say no uh wish I could go to dinner with you guys
but I'm actually um I'm camping out with my kids that weekend
like now I'm taking control and I'm dominating the year not other people taking it away from me
right well you can laugh about it
but I'm dead serious I'm laughing because I think it's cool you know that experiment where they take a jar
and they're like all right you have these rocks in these sand F put them in the put as much as you can in the jar and basically if you put the sand in first you can't put any of the rocks in right cuz all the little meetings and appointments and zoom calls and everything else takes up all the space versus if you put the rocks in first and then you could pour as much sand will fit all the way around it that's basically kind of like the the model of what you're doing you're basically saying I'm going to put all the I really want to be intentional about the life experiences I'm going to remember with the people I care about I'm going to put those on the calendar first and then I'll let all the little knick-knack appointments fill in around that where there's still space
and if I do it the other way like most people do where you say
like when I have time then I'm going to do something great
and then they never have time and nothing ever happens rocks never get in exactly and the reason why guys I like to have this on one big visual like look at all 365 days on one page the reason why I like to do that is a I'm visual like I need to see it you know we're all we all kind of think in pictures and we think visually but now two two things one I can see where my gaps are I can see where my gaps are where I have more time available and not two I can track towards my goals so much better than versus like if they live you know in my phone
and I use my phone for my appointment Zoom calls and all that stuff
but I don't like scrolling through it to be like oh my marathon and I'm scrolling all the way to November I like to see it like
oh I have this many days it's like the road map is visual so for you know to have it all on one big calendar is is really helpful and I'm super spontaneous you know I know that I look if you don't plan it it probably won't happen so knowing that after being on Earth for five and a half decades what do I do I want to plan as much as I can I want to get in front of it so I sit with my wife We sync up all of our stuff you know in 2025 we're going to like I said I'm going to Finland we have a trip to Japan we're going to Greece you know we we have put all this down on our C my 2025 is already mapped out and it's insane
all I have to do is follow the script now yours might not be as as you know wild as mine um
but the point is you can troll it and you can map out this incredible year
do you
but do are you picking those quarterly habits as well as those mini Adventures I'm not I'm not because I'm open I'm always listening to people and and when I was when I had Marquee jet which is a company that I had I started with my partner when I was I don't know 29 30 years old um my dad owned the plumbing supply house I had no relationship with money we never talked about it I had no business experience I didn't know and all of a sudden I had this private jet company we're flying 3,000 of the who who of Pop Culture CEOs top CEOs athletes entertainers and I'm getting access to these people and I'm really curious I'm 30 years years old and anytime I had a minute with anybody at the airport if I was visiting a customer client I would say to them like I want to know how they live the rich like you mentioned people here might not be well they might be one day who's going to tell them how to do where do you vacation what do you do with your money what time do you go to bed how many newspapers do you read I want to know it all I want to know the best habits and routines and mindset from the best people on the planet
and I became sponge
and I remember asking this guy sitting down with this guy I'm not gonna say his first name is James he was insanely wealthy I'm 30 I'm like nothing
and I I asked him I said James how do you live rich and he's like he sent to me
I read and he you walk me through his through his day and where he vacations and what he does with his money and how much gold he has buried in his backyard and all this never forgot it one thing that he said to me one thing he said to me he goes and I take three hours a day for myself and I'm I can never do that there don't
no it's cumulative I'm like
well what does that look like you James he like I might take a 30 minute son in the morning I might take a little time at lunch to read go for a walk work out da d da the end of the day it's about three hours a day for myself and
I I was like since then I'm like
and I was like why and he was like well you know if you check the ubbox you show up as a parent husband been CEO boss employee so much better you don't resent your wife or your husband or your partner for taking away time of the things you want to do all this stuff long story short
I started taking two or three hours a day right after that
I'm like they worked for him I'm not gonna wait till I have a bazillion dollars I'm gonna do it now
so time Rich something that we talked about earlier doesn't mean you have to be rich to be Tim Rich you have to be organized scheduled and allocated to prioritize you
and that's all I'm saying for 2025 you might say Jesse this is Hokey Pokey fine
but all I'm telling you is carve out time for you to give you Adventure make you feel com work's always going to be there it's always gonna be there on a week toe basis do do you make a list of your to-dos for the week before
so um I look at my week on Sunday night I take it from my calendar and from my phone and I put it on paper I use a planner but you can also just write a piece of paper and I write down my day it's like I can move things around and then I can prepare better I know it's I like to have a weak at a glance view of everything and then and then the last thing I would say this is L like a little bonus thought for people is remember when you were a kid
and I don't know if your parents gave you vitamins did they give you vitamins when you were a kid like four School Flintstones Vitamins for sure
Flintstones right I Flintstones Vitamins as a kid anti Flinstone vitamins
but that's that's that'll be podcast number three the the the the vitamins were like you know you take one vitamin and it had like you 500% of everything you needed in every category in like one little pill
and I that's unbelievable
but you know you took your daily vitamins and it checked all the boxes so I have my own version of this that I do Sam um and Sean that that works really well so like if you made a list imagine you all the time in the world you could do whatever you wanted to do every day what how would you spend your day
well I know exactly what I would want to do I love saunas I love coal plunges I love running biking swimming and exercise I love doing breath work I love taking walks with my wife I love playing with my kids like I'm very clear on what it is by the way no where I say do I say I love buying art
but I don't those are the things I love to do they're very simple I inherited that from a very simple man my dad the let's say I have 10 of those things on my list
those are my vitamins those are the things that make me strong that I need every day I try to do two take two or three of those vitamins I can't do them all but I I try to do two or three so today it's we're recording this now it's one o'clock
but I've already gone for an hour run and I've taken an hour sauna so of the three hours I allocate for myself I've already done about two of them so like my day is good
and I've taken two of my vitamins so now when I show up for you guys I'm all in I'm not Outsourcing like we talked about I'm all in you know because I checked me I'm showing up so much better that is so fraking important and that's every day for me this is amazing
um this is awesome is there before I ask you my my kind of I have one burning question before I ask you my burning question is there anything else in the planning how to make a kickass defining 2025 is there anything else we miss before we do that uh do that or were those the big ones I think at like a high level trying to get people to rethink how they approach the new year I think that you know just get started on those things I mean you might not have it all laid out I don't have it all laid out yet but put the stuff you want to do down first on a calendar or wherever you want to put it and build a year that you're super proud of because let me let me just say this Sean we don't get a lot of years we don't get a lot of years and we don't know how many years we're going to get so shame on you if you waste 2025 because you want to like
oh I'll just do it NE
the following year don't like time doesn't work like that you don't have the luxury of like you don't dictate the pace sometimes the pace dictates you and circumstances change and like you know everyone thinks like I guarantee you everybody here knows they're gon to die that's listening to this but I guarantee less than 1% of our listeners have their graveyard plot picked out because they don't think they're gonna die anytime soon they don't think that like your life could change like that my life's been turned upside down I have people that my friends are getting diagnosed with you know like it changes man you can go outside and someone could be texting
and you get smacked it just it could go like
that you don't know so you know I'm 56 years old the average American lives to be 78 I don't know I'm not really good at math
but that's 22 years if I'm average
and you know I was on a lake this summer I didn't see a lot of 78y old guys weight boarding like the the years that you have to do an Ultram man what do they say um I was just listening to something they said what 63 is the shelf life of like healthy years or something you know like it's insane
so you it's also insane that you plan these you like
well I'll get to it when I'm older
but then when you're older it's like I don't want to do that you know what I mean like uh you know I've always criticized actually waren Buffett where he talks about like delayed gratification and things like this and I'm like dude you you've been the man for years like you enjoy it enjoy that now like sometimes p time rich man you don't have to be rich to be time
Rich that book that went kind of viral this this year last year die with zero talks about some of these principles but he has this great story about one of them that he was talking about when he was in his 20s and he was on his career ladder climb and he was at some Investment Bank and his buddy we worked with him they were kind of both 23 years old or whatever was like hey dude what if we just go to Europe backpacking for like you know six weeks
he's like how are you going to get six weeks off he's like I'm not I got to quit and like I hope I'll be able to get the job when I come back
but like I'm going to do this and he was like dude you're crazy that's like irresponsible I'm going to do the responsible thing
and he didn't do that
and he's he told himself he would do it you know maybe next year or the year after that maybe some some reason he'd be able to do it in the future
so you know he's like as soon as he sh came back after six weeks he didn't have the job back but he he met up with the guy he's like from the glow on this dude's face I realized then I made a mistake he talks about how when he was 33 then 10 years later he finally like took a career break
and he's like went to Europe
he's like it's not so cool sleeping in a hostel when you're 33 um you know it's a different
he's like I learned that some things you can't even just it's not even just doing them later is worse he's like it's just not the same thing like that's a 23y old trip I didn't do it when I was 23 I did it when I was 33 or 34 and I had to have a whole different experience there was no going back to that
I think it's really important to say yes to Adventure
and um it's never the right time you know like it's never going to be like
oh I have eight days that are clean you have to make it you have to create that you know
I think that's really important message like it's never the right time you're always I'm going to miss the basketball game you know there's always a sacrifice but if you don't do it just you know you have regret you just regret it you just don't get it back
well you said yes to an Adventure you're coming to our basketball camp with Mr Beast so we'll be seeing you in January for one of those Jesse thanks for coming on
and if you're listening to this you made it to the end you're fired up like I am we're giving away a few thousand of these calendars so go to Jesse what's the site where people buy the calendar I have the code here

I loved it that's his job
and I get it and um you guys are awesome man like I always get a lot of DMS about our our first episode so um to get an invitation back was meant a lot to me man
